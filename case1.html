        <h1>What was it?</h1>
        <p>This was my very first hand at code and making a wbsite. I chose to base my site around sustainability
          since it is a subject I find to be interesting and a burning topic nowadays and it should have more recogniion
          online.
        </p>
        <p>My goal was to work wih a code template, given by GitHub, and to make it my own, so this challenged me to see
          how far I can push the code's boundries to make the website look completely different to what it began as. 
          Eventhough it was nerve-racking to face code for the fist time, I was determined to explore the possibilites.

    <!-- PROBLEM / GOAL -->
    <section class="case-section fade-in">
      <div class="case-text">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The main obstacle was facing HTML and CSS for the first time, it was quite overwhelming to work with and I could not make sense of the structure
          of the code and what the different elements you had to account for, such as, padding, margins ect. I also found it extremely difficult to let go of 
          something going wrong. If something was out of place, not responding correctly I would work on it until it was to my liking; in which shows my determination
          but it costed me a lot of my time.
        </p>
        <p>On the contrary, despite my commitment to make the website look exactly like my vision, some of it did not turn out this way.
          The carousel for example on the left, I spent so long editing a template of a code snippet to make the carousel have a different layout, which I achieved, but it
          was missing that polish and well, I ran out of time to do much more about it and I could not experiment more with the est of the parts of my website. So, this Project
          taught me a very valuable lesson on time management and that if something does not come out the way we want, it is okay to leave it and come back to it when there
          is other priorities.
