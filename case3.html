    <h1>What was it?</h1>
    <p>Reflective case study focusing on how I designed and developed my personal portfolio. This portfolio is an embodiment
      of the work I have created and how my skills have evolved over the years as a designer and coder. It is also an area where I can
      showcase my love for my favourite hobby, art, and with this porfolio I can display my work for me and others to enjoy.

<!-- PROBLEM / GOAL -->
<section class="case-section fade-in">
  <div class="case-text">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this project was to create a professional digital portfolio that communicated both my technical 
      and creative abilities as a Web and User Experience Designer. I wanted the site to reflect my personality, 
      interests and love for video game art, while still presenting my work in a clear, structured and professional 
      way. The main challenge was balancing creativity with usability, ensuring that the design remained engaging 
      without becoming cluttered or difficult to navigate.

      <h3>Moodboard & Inspiration</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/portfoliomb.png" alt="">
      <p>
        My design direction was heavily inspired by retro and indie games such as Stardew Valley and Undertale.
        These references helped shape my colour palette, typography and overall aesthetic, blending nostalgia,
        soft earthy and pastel tones and playful digital elements that represent my creative identity.

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/portfoliowireframes.png" alt="">
      <p>
        I created a series of sketches to experiment with layout ideas, navigation styles and content hierarchy.
        These early drawings helped me visualise user flow and decide how to present my case studies and personal
        information in a clear and visually balanced way before starting the build in code.

      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/portfoliocode1.png" alt="">
      <p>
        The website was hand-coded using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. I experimented with unique visual
        elements, hover effects and layouts which later became a challenge when making the site responsive. Testing
        on different screen sizes highlighted the importance of flexible design and accessibility.   
      </p>

      <p>I experimented a lot with JavaScript in particular to help my elements come to life, for example with my character. Having
        her just displayed on the page would have been a waste so, making that talking animation was a must. Eventhough it is a short
        moment, it took a lot of research and code to make it happen and I am proud how it came out.

<!-- Conclusion -->

  <div class="outcome-text">
    <h2>Final Design</h2>
     <p>
    The final visual style features soft greens, warm neutrals and gentle pastel accents, inspired by natural,
    calming game environments. The typography combines expressive headings with simple, readable body text to
    ensure clarity and accessibility. This outcome evolved directly from my original moodboard and refined into
    a cohesive, professional design system.

<!-- OUTCOMES -->
<section class="case-outcome fade-in">
  <div class="outcome-text">
    <h2>Key Outcomes & Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a completely hand-coded portfolio using HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Created a strong visual identity inspired by retro and indie video games</li>
      <li>Improved responsive design through peer feedback and testing</li>
