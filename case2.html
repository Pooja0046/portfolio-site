    <h1>What was it?</h1>
    <p>
      This project involved designing and developing a content-managed website using WordPress,
      then replicating the same design as a fully static site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
      I chose to theme the website around <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong>, a character who
      first introduced me to the world of video games and inspired my interest in game art.
    </p>

    <p>
      My aim was to create an information website celebrating Sonic’s history, multimedia legacy,
      and unique design identity. The project also required the site to be editable by a peer,
      which challenged me to think about layout flexibility and how the UX adapts when someone
      else controls the content.

<!-- PROBLEM / GOAL -->
<section class="case-section fade-in">
  <div class="case-text">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      The most significant challenge in this project was learning how to work with WordPress.
      Although I had developed coded sites before, the structure of WordPress themes, widgets,
      plugins, and page builders felt overwhelming at first, and I struggled to customise the
      theme to match my creative vision. These difficulties created major time constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, I had to reverse the intended workflow—I built the static coded site first
      to establish a design direction, and only afterward attempted to recreate it inside
      WordPress. Because of this time pressure, neither version fully matched the original
      vision I had for honouring the Sonic franchise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite this, the project taught me valuable lessons about adapting under pressure,
      managing time effectively, and designing layouts that remain functional even when
      unexpected content is added by external editors.

    <div class="step-card">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonicresearch1.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Explored official Sonic websites, fan archives, and retro UI inspirations.  
        Identified recurring themes—energy, bold shapes, and bright colours—which shaped
        the site’s visual direction and page structure. Sites I loved included Sonic Stadium and
        SonictheHedgehog.com.

    <div class="step-card">
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonicwireframes.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to plan the layout for the key pages:
        Home, Media Mania, Sonic Evolution, Stereo Sonic, and Metaverse Madness.
        Designed the structure to translate cleanly into both WordPress and HTML/CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a style guide consisting of bold primary colours as these are usually associated with 
        the Sonic brand. The chosen fonts reflect the playful yet bold tone of the website, Orbitron (Heading Font): A futuristic, geometric font that feels modern and fast, mimicking a tech or game-like style—perfect for titles and navigation.
Open Sans (Body Font): A clean, versatile sans-serif font that’s highly legible on screens and pairs well with Orbitron without stealing attention.

      <h3>User Testing Plan</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonicusertesting.png" alt="">
      <p>
        I created a user testing plan to follow so I could conduct my testing session smoothly. I just
        outlined the specific tasks I wanted my peer to complete and the scope of the activity.

    <div class="step-card">
      <h3>Peer Testing</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonictest1.png" alt="">
      <p>
        A peer tested my WordPress site by adding new content and images.  
        This highlighted issues in responsiveness, spacing, and image scaling,
        helping me identify weaknesses in the theme’s flexibility. My peer was a big fan of chickens it seemed...

      <h3>Design</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonicsreenshotdocument1.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Another part of the module was to create a design process document where I had to journal 
        the entire journey of all my decisions when making this website. I really enjoyed designing This
        document as I really felt like I captured the Sonic feel, something I wish I was able to do more 
        for my actual website.

      <h3>Kanban Board</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonickanban.png" alt="">
      <p>
        When it comes to developing a website, having a clear plan to follow is essential. I used a technique which was inspired by
        a “Kanban board”. A kanban board is a tool in which is used to help with time management when developing a project; this 
        method originated in the 1940s. It consists of 4 sections: “backlog”, “to do”, “doing” and “done”. Documenting these different 
        elements is useful as it gives you a clear idea on what you are currently working on, what you have completed and what needs to
         be done; it helps you to see how much you are progressing and the pace you are progressing through the project.
