    <h1>What was it?</h1>
    <p>
      This project involved designing and developing a content-managed website using WordPress,
      then replicating the same design as a fully static site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
      I chose to theme the website around <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong>, a character who
      first introduced me to the world of video games and inspired my interest in game art.
    </p>

    <p>
      My aim was to create an information website celebrating Sonic’s history, multimedia legacy,
      and unique design identity. The project also required the site to be editable by a peer,
      which challenged me to think about layout flexibility and how the UX adapts when someone
      else controls the content.

<!-- PROBLEM / GOAL -->
<section class="case-section fade-in">
  <div class="case-text">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      The most significant challenge in this project was learning how to work with WordPress.
      Although I had developed coded sites before, the structure of WordPress themes, widgets,
      plugins, and page builders felt overwhelming at first, and I struggled to customise the
      theme to match my creative vision. These difficulties created major time constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, I had to reverse the intended workflow—I built the static coded site first
      to establish a design direction, and only afterward attempted to recreate it inside
      WordPress. Because of this time pressure, neither version fully matched the original
      vision I had for honouring the Sonic franchise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite this, the project taught me valuable lessons about adapting under pressure,
      managing time effectively, and designing layouts that remain functional even when
      unexpected content is added by external editors.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonic-research.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Explored official Sonic websites, fan archives, and retro UI inspirations.  
        Identified recurring themes—energy, bold shapes, and bright colours—which shaped
        the site’s visual direction and page structure.

    <div class="step-card">
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonic-wireframes.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to plan the layout for the key pages:
        Home, Media Mania, Sonic Evolution, Stereo Sonic, and Metaverse Madness.
        Designed the structure to translate cleanly into both WordPress and HTML/CSS.

    <div class="step-card">
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/sonic-testing.png" alt="">
      <p>
        A peer tested my WordPress site by adding new content and images.  
        This highlighted issues in responsiveness, spacing, and image scaling,
        helping me identify weaknesses in the theme’s flexibility.
